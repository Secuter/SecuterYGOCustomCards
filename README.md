# SecuterYGOCustomCards
I've created a simple site on Github Pages to provide a quick preview of the cards.<br>
It doesn't load all 1000+ card images right away on page load but only downloads the needed ones when an archetype is selected, it may take a bit if you click multiple archetypes quickly. :wink:

If you can't see custom cards in Edopro you have to check 'Alternate formats', this show all cards including anime and custom cards.

## Original summoning mechanics
![customtypes](https://imgur.com/YBo3tZU.png)
- **Reverse-Xyz**: similar to Xyz Monster but uses subtraction between the monster levels.
- **Reunion**: Extra Deck monsters that are Special Summoned using monsters with a sum of Levels/Ranks/Links equal to its Level x2.
usually use monsters from your field but there are some that can use monsters from the GY or opponent monsters.
Originally this summon method belongs only to the Anuaks but they shared it with the other clans.
- **Ignition**: Extra Deck monsters that use as material 1 monster from the field and 1 or more cards from the hand.
This summon method is unique to Morhais, but they could teach it to others as well... (The backgroung of Inigtion monsters is changed from the previous version)
- **Echo**: Main Deck monsters that replaces Over-Fusion. Uses 1 Extra Deck Monster as material that becomes equipped to the Echo Monster, the type of Extra Deck Monster depends on the Echo Monster (may be an Xyz, a Fusion, etc. ...)
- **Armor**: Can be any type of cards. They have a ATK/DEF bonus and an additinal effect when used as armor. Attaching an armor target the monster and the armor go under the monster like Xyz materials, bacause of this they are incompatible with Xyz monsters, armor cards cannot be attached to Xyz monsters. An Xyz monster can be summoned with an Armor monster but it not gain any of its Armor effects.
- **Armorizing**: Extra Deck monsters related with armor cards, they are summoned using 1 monster that has X or more armors, eg. 1 Dragon monsters with 3+ armors
The minimum number of armors the material must have are also the number of 'Shield' stars in the monster level. (A monster that require 2 armors as material will be Shell Rank 2, the yellow shields in the Level. They have both a Shell Rank and a Level, the level is the sum of shields and stars.). Armorizing monsters can be also Armor monsters.
- **Exarmorizing**: Extra Deck monsters that share the same Summoning Type as Armorizing, the only difference is that they uses 2 or more monsters as material. There are both Exrmorizing Armor Monsters and non-Armor ones.
### Other mechanics without a new card type
- **Exchange**: They are effect monsters similar to Spirit, they return to the hand during the End Phase and the Exchange Summon and then you can Exchange Summon a monster from hand that meets certain conditions depending on the card, eg. it could be a WATER monster, a Level 4 or a specific archetype. (They don't return to the hand if Exchange Summoned this turn.) Most Echange Monsters have an effect when Exchange Summoned or related to it.
- **Runic**: Runic cards are Runic Monsters and Runic Spells/Traps.
	- **Runic Spells/Traps**: They have has 2 effects: the main card effect that is applied when you activate the card, and the runic effect (after 'â—† Runic Effect: ') which cannot be used directly by the Spell/Trap but it has to be copied by a Runic Monster.
	- **Runic Monsters**: They are monsters with an effect that allows you to apply the Runic Effect of Spells/Traps. The Runic Spell/Trap usually is chosen when paying the cost of the effect, eg. when you send it to the grave, discard it or banish it depending on what indicated in the monster effect.
	- How work Runic Effects?<br>
They work the same way as Traptrix Rafflesia with Trap Holes, you send to the grave (or discard/banish/... depending on the effect) as cost the Runic Spell/Trap, and then you apply the Runic Effect.<br>
Eg. If i activate 'Dark Sovereign Codex' as a Spell card I discard 1 card and search for a 'Dark Sovereign' monster (it's normal effect).<br>
But if I activate the effect of any Runic monster like 'Dark Sovereign Executioner' by discarding 'Dark Sovereign Codex', in this case I apply the Runic Effect and Special summon 1 Level 4 or lower 'Dark Sovereign' monster from my Deck.
	- OPT Clause with Runic Effects<br>
The S/T Card and the Runic effect have different Once per turn clause, so I can copy the Runic effect of a spell card I already activated this turn. At this time the only Runic deck is 'Dark Sovereign' and all its Runic cards has a OPT both on the card and on the Runic effect, so I can activate both the same turn but each one only once each turn.

## Configuration

You can either edit your configs.json to add custom cards repositories and the server, or download the [preconfigured configs.json](etc/configs.json) with the server and all the necessary repositories to have all the cards available on the server.<br>
Your file is located in the Edopro installation folder -> PATH\ProjectIgnis\config\configs.json<br>
If you replace the file, check that the default repositories have not changed (the one provided here is automatically updated They usually only change when a major release is released, e.g. when it changes from version 40 to 41.<br>
Before overwriting the configuration file, check that the default repositories have not changed (the file provided here is automatically updated daily, taking changes from the official Edopro repository, but it's always good to double-check :grinning:). Usually, Edopro repositories are only changed with major releases, eg. when it went from version 39 to 40.<br>
If you have a lot of repositories is reccomended to backup the configs.json file because when Edopro is updated this file is overwritten with the default one.

As you can see in the configs.json I have 2 repositories, 1 for images and 1 for everything else. This is because this way, only the repository containing scripts, databases, etc., is downloaded each time you start Edopro (approximately 7 MB), while the card images are downloaded only once when you view the card in Edopro for the first time. (It's the same with original TCG/OCG cards.)<br>
This is done to avoid a delay when opening Edopro. It may not be relevant for repositories with a small size and a limited number of cards, but for mine, which currently has a size of 1 GB in card images, this separation is necessary.<br>
The only drawback of this approach is that the image is not updated if it's modified on the repo; you have to manually delete the card(s) from the "pics" folder to download the new one.
For changes in the card's effect, you won't even notice the difference. Personally, I mostly read the text beneath the card, which is bigger :smile:. That's why I avoid making changes to card materials, level, or ATK/DEF. If it's absolutely necessary, I notify the cards with these changes in the releases on GitHub.<br>

Other developers' repositories contained in the configs file may also have additional archetypes not present on the server.<br>
Here is a list of archetypes supported on the server in addition to mine.

## Custom banlist
I also created a custom banlist '2023.04 Secuter+TCG' that uses the last TCG as a base adding limits/bans for my cards.<br>
On the server it is recommended to play with this banlist and 'Anything goes'. (You must select 'Anything goes' to play with cards with the custom tag event if this cards are accepted on the server.)<br>

#### Banned
* none
#### Limited
* D.D. Invader Gargoyle
* Allure of Darkness
#### Semi-Limited
* none
#### Unbanned cards

## Decks & replays showing some combos

Unfortunately, decks and replays are not downloaded automatically in Edopro, so I've created separate repositories with sample decks for all my archetypes and replays that showcase an example combo for some decks.

#### Example decklists

## Custom MSE

Custom MSE with my custom card types: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ud7nordPqC3zbp7vqgUKH45VW-HymRzm/view?usp=sharing

It also contains some useful features and shortcuts for frequently used text in Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

#### Export cards as a SQL insert

You have to click on the Export Set icon > HTML > Sql (Sql Exporter).

![Sql Exporter](https://imgur.com/7eNfunG.png)<br>
It creates a SQL INSERT with all the cards selected with the correct structure for Edopro database, the only fields left empty are str1, str2, ... because the export script can't know which are the different parts of the effect. You'll have to manually update those.
